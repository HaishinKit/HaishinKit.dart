[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/haishin_kit.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/haishin_kit)

* A Flutter plugin for iOS, Android. Camera and Microphone streaming library via RTMP.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is being developed with the goal of defining a Flutter interface for HaishinKit.
> However, since development is progressing slowly, I recommend using other plugins if you need something stable or are in a hurry.

## üí¨ Communication

  everyone as long
  as [the code of conduct](https://github.com/HaishinKit/HaishinKit.dart?tab=coc-ov-file) is
  followed.
* Whether someone is a contributor to HaishinKit is mainly determined by their GitHub profile icon.
  If you are using the default icon, there is a chance your input might be overlooked, so please
  consider setting a custom one. It could be a picture of your pet, for example. Personally, I like
  cats.
* If you want to support e-mail based communication without GitHub.
